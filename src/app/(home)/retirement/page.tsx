									<li>
										Aside from keeping your loved ones&apos;

										While having a 401(k) or IRA is a great
										start, a solid financial plan takes a
										closer look at the income you have
										coming in, and the amount you&apos;ll
										need to supplement. The earlier you
										start planning, the longer you have to
										build up your savings and put your plan
										into action. But even if you plan on
										retiring in the next year or two,
										there&apos;s time to get prepared.

								We often hear about the importance of starting
								early to save for retirement, but it&apos;s hard
								to visualize the difference that starting early
								can make. Regardless of the rate of return (as
								long as it&apos;s greater than zero) a person
								who only saves from ages 25&ndash;35, will
								always have considerably more money by age 60,
								than the person who saved from ages 35&ndash;60.
								Thanks to compounding interest, you can end up
								with more money, after saving for fewer years,
								as long as you start earlier.
