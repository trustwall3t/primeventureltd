										Mutual funds are steadily making an
										entry into the household savings with an
										increased awareness about financial
										planning and higher efforts towards
										promoting mutual funds as an investment
										product. Further, the availability of a
										wide range of mutual fund schemes makes
										it easier for you to choose the mutual
										fund scheme to suit your financial
										goals. Moreover, with everything
										becoming more expensive, investment in
										traditional instruments might not live
										up to your expectations. This is where
										investments in mutual funds can be
										beneficial. Whatever your goals might
										be, there are mutual funds to help meet
										them.

										A second className of property flipper
										also exists. These investors make their
										money by buying reasonably priced
										properties and adding value by
										renovating them. This can be a
										longer-term investment depending on the
										extent of the improvements. The limiting
										feature of this investment is that it is
										time intensive and often only allows
										investors to take on one or two
										properties at a time hence we try to
										avoid properties with high maintenance
										cost and focus more on properties with
										high undervalue&apos;
